# Macroeconomics Calculator

Hi! I'm Youcef Boutemedjet, a university student studying Financial Management. This is my first Python project. I built this calculator to help compute basic **macroeconomic indicators** that I study in class.

## What this program does

This calculator can help you compute things like:

- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
- Inflation Rate
- Unemployment Rate
- Real Interest Rate
- Money Supply
- Exchange Rate
- Fiscal Deficit
- Public Debt
- Trade Balance
- Current Account Balance
- Economic Growth Rate
- Real GDP
- GDP per Capita
- Investment Ratios (Public, Private, etc.)

All using basic formulas from macroeconomics.

##  Why I made it
I created this project to:
- Practice using Python
- Understand economic concepts more deeply
- Build something small but useful on my own


##  How to run it
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Download the file `calculator.py`.
3. Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
